### Additional Configuration

Vite offers a lot of customization options. You can configure it further by editing the vite.config.js (or vite.config.ts if using TypeScript) file in your project directory.

With these steps, you'll have a Vite-powered React project up and running, providing you with a fast and efficient development experience.
